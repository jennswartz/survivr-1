How does your gem take advantage of Ruby's metaprogramming capabilities?
My gem takes advantage of Ruby's metaprogramming capabilities by using send and define_method
to create the create_colors method.


How long did you spend working on this project?
I worked on it periodically over the course of several days.

What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
I figured out how to make it work.  It took me a while to figure out how to make create_colors
method in a succinct manner.

Where do you still have room to grow?
Everywhere.  I'm still finding many concepts very abstract.
